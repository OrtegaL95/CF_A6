# CF_A6_Federal Building Utilization Analysis
For the Advanced Analytics & Dashboard Design project, I selected public datasets to perform in-depth analysis. Using Python visualization libraries, I created engaging and interactive data dashboards. This project focused on enhancing my skills in machine learning, regression and cluster analysis, and advanced data visualization techniques.

## Objective
The focus of analysis was on utilization effficiency: How effectively are federal buildings utilized across the country? Are there significant differences in utilization rates between different property types (e.g., office buildings, warehouses)?
 
Hypothesis: Buildings with larger square footage have lower utilization rates (measured by the number of federal employees per square foot) compared to smaller office spaces.

Rationale: Preliminary observations suggest variability in utilization rates, especially in larger buildings.

## Data
Collected FY 22 & FY23 Federal Real Property Profile data sets from data.gov via the U.S. General Services Administration.
